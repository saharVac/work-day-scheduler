# Work Day Scheduler

This Workday Scheduler helps log activities for every hour from 9AM through 5PM. The hours are dynamically color-coded, with past hours in grey, current hour in red and future hours in green. Using local stoarage, the user can log a task by clicking in the lock button. Working on this assignment helped me understand JSON parsing and stringifying and why it is necessary to employ the JSON methods. I also gained a deeper understanding of jQuery element manipulation and am really comfortable using it.
